# My website, but not compiled!

Here is the source code for my website.

I'm using vite and react to make and compile the page. The CSS is handled through Sass.

## Project structure
+ `/public` contains image files and some icons (in `/assets`)
+ `/src` contains the react project
  + `/components` contains smaller components that make up the main page
+ `/dev` contains some raw files that where used to make the images and assets
