                    Hello, I am a person on the internet. I call myself Unskilled Wolf. (The name came from my playing Video Games)<br />
                    I like to write code, design websites, and I also create 2D and 3D art.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I started teaching myself programming at a relatively young age.<br />
                    I have learned a few languages so far starting, with C++ for a short time and then moving to C# and Unity. Sometime later, I moved to Python, Javascript, ReactJS, Typescript, and more.<br />
                    While the programming languages I currently know are all high level, I am teaching myself the much lower level Rust.<br />
                    Everything that I know, I have thought myself.<br />
                    I also know how to use Linux, and I use Arch Linux as my secondary OS.
                    Here is a general <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zMfMIFTdyRdSlHLHXM-zpDJNlw98EywLYSkkgZk9QYw/edit?usp=sharing">List</a> of the things that I know how to do.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also enjoy playing video games such as Minecraft, Factorio, Titanfall2, ARK Survival Evolved, Tetris, and many others. It is likely that I will <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/unskilled_wolf">stream</a> games eventually.
                </p>

                <p>If you want to contact me, send me a DM on Twitter. A better way of contacting will be available in the future.</p>
