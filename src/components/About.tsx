                    Hello, I am a person on the internet. I call myself Unskilled Wolf. (Because I am bad at playing Video Games)<br />
                    I like to write code, make websites, and I also create art.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I started teaching myself programming at a relatively young age.<br />
                    I have learned a few languages so far starting, with C++ for a short time and then moving to C# and Unity. Sometime later, I moved to Python, Javascript, ReactJS, Typescript, and more.<br />
                    While the programming languages I currently know are all high level, I am teaching myself the much lower level Rust.<br />
                    Everything that I know, I have thought myself.<br />
                    Linux is my favorite OS, Minecraft is my Favorite Game, and <a href="https://youtu.be/04aegrl_TCg">Colossus</a> by Vector Moon is my favorite song.<br />
                    Here is a general <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zMfMIFTdyRdSlHLHXM-zpDJNlw98EywLYSkkgZk9QYw/edit?usp=sharing">List</a> of the things that I know how to do.
                </p>

                    <i>Obviously, don't use my code, art, or characters without my permission</i>
                </p>
            </div>

                <p>If you want to contact me, send me a note on DeviantArt or a DM on Twitter.</p>
