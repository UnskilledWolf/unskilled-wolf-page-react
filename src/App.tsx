        I mainly draw furry characters, but I also create some vector and pixel art, and I am slowly starting to draw terrain and animations.

          I create websites. I use ReactJS for the front end and NodeJS + Express for the backend. I also have used Vue and Angular before, but I don't know as much about them.<br />
                        I obviously created this website myself.

          I used to create games, but most of them are old and do not reflect my current skill and knowledge. I want to work on something in the future, but my most current work comes from my websites.<br />
        To create games, I used Unity3D, but I have now switched to Godot. I also made some small things in Processing and P5.<br />
        I also have some <b>OLD</b> games on <a href="https://ldjam.com/users/gerox">Ludum Dare</a> (As I said, Old and Simple Games)
