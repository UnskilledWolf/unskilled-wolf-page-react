          I am a relative beginner digital artist, who mainly draws furry characters. While I often draw digitally, I also sometimes draw traditionally. I make Vector Art, Pixel Art, and 3D art. Currently, my main focus is to improve at drawing terrain and expressions. I also plan to animate in the future.

          I create websites. I commonly use ReactJS for the front end and NodeJS + Express for the backend. I have used Vue and Angular before, but I don't know as much about them. I also know how to use some SQL and No-SQL databases.<br />
          I build this website using ReactJS by myself.

          I like working with code to make scripts and software. While I am mainly accustomed to high-level languages, I am working on also learning lower-level ones.<br />
          I used to create games, but most of them are old and do not reflect my current skill or knowledge. I want to work on something in the future, but my most current work comes from my websites.<br />
          To create games, I used Unity3D, but I have now switched to Godot. I also made some small things in Processing and P5.<br />
          I have some <b>OLD</b> games on <a href="https://ldjam.com/users/gerox">Ludum Dare</a> (I have gotten better since then.)
