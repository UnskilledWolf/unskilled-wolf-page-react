            <p>I have experience in various computer fields. From web design to game making, I have worked on many things.</p>
            <p>Some of my projects have included creating games using engines like Godot and Unity3D in C#. Using Typescript, I halve also designed react websites and express js backends. I'm also able to create scripts to automate many tasks in Python.</p>
            <p>A list of things that I have experimented with is <button className="button-link">here</button>.</p>
            <p>A collection of portfolio projects will be included here in the future. Meanwhile, you can find this site's source code <a href="https://github.com/UnskilledWolf/unskilled-wolf-page-react">here</a>.</p>

            <p>I create digital and occasionally traditional art. While my skills in this field are still in need of improvement, I strive to enhance my methods with each artwork.</p>
            <p>In addition to 2D art, I'm also able to create vector graphic designs. Another medium that I sometimes work with is video-editing and visual effects. In the future, I will also focus on learning 2D animation.</p>
            <p>Some software that I am familiar with includes Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe After Effects, and Procreate.</p>

          <Article id="3d" title="3D" image='/images/3D.png'>
            <p>In addition to 2D forms of digital media, I'm also working to create 3D artworks using Blender. These projects have ranged from rigged character models to decorated rooms and small landscapes. This included the VTuber model, that I use in my live streams and VRChat, for example.</p>
            <p>I especially like to create procedural materials, and recently, I have also enjoyed working on many projects using geometry nodes.</p>

          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>Ever since a streak of particularly unfavorable games in Apex Legends, I have chosen the username UnskilledWolf. Alternatively, I sometimes go by Axiom, the anthro wolf character representing me online.</p>
          <p>I work on many different types of projects, mostly to do with computers. This has led me to experiment with code, art, 3d modeling, animation, system administration, databases, lower-level programming, complex-ish math, electronics, and recently even music. Although I am only proficient at some of them, I enjoy working on many different types of work (As long as I can remain seated in a chair). In addition to that, almost everything that I know is self-taught!</p>
          <p>I also enjoy playing video games such as Minecraft, Noita, Factorio, Titanfall2, Apex Legends, Tetris, and many others. For half a year, I streamed Noita daily on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/unskilled_wolf">Twitch</a>. Now I only do the occasional stream.</p>
