            I am a gradually improving digital artist, who specializes in furry artworks. While I typically draw digitally, I also draw traditionally sometimes. I can also make Vector Art, and 3D art. Currently, my main focus is to improve at expressions. I also plan to animate in the future.<br />

            You can see my art on my <a href="https://deviantart.com/hexagonal192">DeviantArt</a>

            I create websites, and I have experience in full-stack development. I usually use ReactJS for the front end and NodeJS + Express for the backend. I also know how to use some SQL and No-SQL databases.<br />
            I build this website using ReactJS by myself.

            I like working with code to make scripts and software. While I am mainly accustomed to high-level languages, I am working on also learning lower-level ones.<br />
            I used to create games, but most of them are old and do not reflect my current skill or knowledge. I want to work on something in the future, but my most current work comes from my websites.<br />
            To create games, I used Unity3D, but I have now switched to Godot. I also made some small things in Processing and P5.<br />
            I have some <b>OLD</b> games on <a href="https://ldjam.com/users/gerox">Ludum Dare</a> (I have gotten better since then.)
